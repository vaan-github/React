# The Story of React Village: Understanding All Hooks

In the bustling React Village, a group of extraordinary friends each had a special role in keeping the village thriving. These friends were known as **Stateful Sam**, **Callback Cassie**, **Effect Eddie**, **Reference Ruby**, and many others. Let’s dive into their story and see how they used their unique abilities to ensure the village was always in harmony.

## Stateful Sam: The Keeper of Memories

Stateful Sam was the most organized villager. He had a special notebook where he kept track of everything that changed in the village. Whether it was the weather, the time of day, or the number of apples in the orchard, Sam wrote it all down.

- **Purpose**: Sam’s job was to remember things that changed over time.
