# Color Changer App

This React application allows users to dynamically change the background color of the screen by clicking on various color buttons. It utilizes the `useState` hook to manage the background color state and Tailwind CSS for styling and animations.

## Features

- **Dynamic Background Color**: Click buttons to change the background color.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with Tailwind CSS for a modern look and feel.
- **Interactive Animations**: Smooth scaling effects on button hover and click.

## How It Works

1. **State Management**: Uses the `useState` hook to handle the current background color.
2. **Buttons**: Each button updates the background color when clicked.
3. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS classes are used for layout, styling, and animations.
