| Hook        | Purpose                                                      | When to Use                                                     | Example Use Case                                                | Key Points                                                      |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `useState`  | Manages state in functional components.                      | When you need to store and update values that affect rendering. | Tracking form input, toggling UI elements, etc.                 | - Returns a state variable and a function to update it.         |
| `useCallback` | Memoizes a function to prevent unnecessary re-creations.   | When passing functions as props to optimize re-renders.         | Preventing child components from re-rendering unnecessarily.    | - Returns a memoized version of the function.                   |
| `useEffect` | Handles side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, etc. | When you need to perform actions after rendering.               | Fetching data from an API, subscribing to events.               | - Can run after every render or conditionally (with dependencies). |
| `useRef`    | Creates a persistent reference that doesnâ€™t trigger re-renders. | When you need to access DOM elements directly or store mutable values that persist across renders. | Managing focus, storing previous values.                       | - Returns a mutable object with a `.current` property.          |
