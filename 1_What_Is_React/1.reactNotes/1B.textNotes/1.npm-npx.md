### NPM (Node Package Manager)

**NPM** is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to manage and share packages of JavaScript code, handling dependencies, scripts, and other tasks within a Node.js environment.

- **Installing Packages:**  
  NPM can install packages locally (for a specific project) or globally (available system-wide). To install a package locally:

  ```bash
  npm install <package-name>
  ```

  To install a package globally:

  ```bash
  npm install -g <package-name>
  ```

- **Managing Dependencies:**  
  When you install a package, NPM updates the `package.json` file to include it as a dependency, which helps manage all the packages your project relies on.

- **Running Scripts:**  
  NPM allows you to define scripts in your `package.json` file to automate tasks like testing or building your project:

  ```bash
  npm run <script-name>
  ```

### NPX (Node Package Runner)

**NPX** is a tool that comes with NPM (since version 5.2.0) and is used to execute packages directly without needing to install them globally. It’s useful for running packages from the NPM registry or your local `node_modules` folder without cluttering your global installs.

- **Running Commands Without Installing Globally:**  
  With NPX, you can run a package without installing it globally. For example, to bootstrap a React project using `create-react-app`:

  ```bash
  npx create-react-app my-app
  ```

  This command temporarily downloads the package, runs it, and then deletes it afterward.

- **Running Local Packages:**  
  If a package is installed locally in your project, you can use NPX to run it without specifying its path explicitly:

  ```bash
  npx <local-package-name>
  ```

### When to Use NPM and NPX?

- **Use NPM** when you need to install, manage, or update packages and handle your project's dependencies and scripts.
  
- **Use NPX** when you want to quickly execute a package without installing it globally or when you need to run a locally installed package without worrying about its path. It’s particularly useful for one-off commands or tools you don't need to keep installed globally.
