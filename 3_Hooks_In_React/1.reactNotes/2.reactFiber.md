## Introduction

React Fiber is a reimplementation of React's core algorithm, designed to improve its suitability for areas like animation, layout, and gestures. The key feature of Fiber is **incremental rendering**, which allows rendering work to be split into chunks and spread out over multiple frames.

### Key Features

- **Incremental Rendering**: Rendering work is broken into units, enabling React to pause, abort, or reuse work as needed.
- **Scheduling**: Prioritizes different types of updates, ensuring smoother animations and interactions.
- **Concurrency Primitives**: Supports concurrent rendering, allowing React to handle multiple updates efficiently.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into Fiber, it's recommended to understand the following concepts:

- [React Components, Elements, and Instances](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/12/18/react-components-elements-and-instances.html)
- [Reconciliation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html)
- [React Basic Theoretical Concepts](https://github.com/reactjs/react-basic)
- [React Design Principles](https://facebook.github.io/react/contributing/design-principles.html)

## Core Concepts

### Reconciliation

Reconciliation is the algorithm React uses to determine which parts of a tree need to be updated. It creates the appearance of a complete re-render while maintaining performance.

Key Points:

- Different component types generate different trees, and React replaces the old tree entirely rather than diffing it.
- Lists are diffed using keys, which should be stable, predictable, and unique.

### Scheduling

Scheduling determines when work should be performed in React. Fiber's architecture allows React to delay updates, prioritize certain tasks, and coalesce updates to improve performance.

Key Points:

- Not every update needs to be applied immediately; some can be delayed.
- Different updates have different priorities; for example, animations should be prioritized over data loading.
- React's pull-based approach allows the framework to manage scheduling, making it smarter and more efficient.

## What is a Fiber?

A fiber represents a **unit of work** in React's rendering process. Fiber enables React to:

- Pause work and resume it later.
- Assign priorities to different work units.
- Reuse completed work.
- Abort work if it's no longer needed.

### Structure of a Fiber

A fiber is a JavaScript object containing information about a component, its input, and its output. Key fields include:

- **`type` and `key`**: Describe the component and are used during reconciliation.
- **`child` and `sibling`**: Represent the recursive tree structure of a fiber.
- **`return`**: The fiber to return to after processing the current one (parent fiber).
- **`pendingProps` and `memoizedProps`**: Represent the input arguments of a fiber.
- **`pendingWorkPriority`**: Indicates the priority of the work.
- **`alternate`**: Refers to the current and work-in-progress fibers.
- **`output`**: The result of rendering, eventually given to the renderer.

## Future Topics

This document is a work in progress. Future sections will cover:

- The scheduler's algorithm for finding the next unit of work.
- How priority is tracked and propagated.
- How the scheduler pauses and resumes work.
- The flushing and completion of work.
- Side-effects and lifecycle methods.
- Coroutines and their role in implementing features like context and layout.
