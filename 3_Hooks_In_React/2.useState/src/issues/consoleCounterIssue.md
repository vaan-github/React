# Explanation of the `consoleCounter` Issue and Solution

The reason `consoleCounter` is not behaving as expected is because it is defined as a regular variable inside the `App` component, which means its value is reset on every re-render of the component. Since React re-renders the `App` component whenever the state changes (i.e., when you call `setCounter`), the `consoleCounter` variable is reinitialized to `15` every time.

## How React Works with State

- **State (`useState`)**: State variables are preserved across re-renders, meaning their values persist even after the component re-renders.
- **Regular Variables**: Regular variables are reinitialized every time the component re-renders, which is why `consoleCounter` is always `15` when you log it.

### Solution

To persist the `consoleCounter` value across re-renders, you need to store it in the state using `useState`. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import { useState } from "react";
import './App.css';

function App() {
  let [counter, setCounter] = useState(15);
  let [consoleCounter, setConsoleCounter] = useState(15); // Use state for consoleCounter

  const addValue = () => {
    setConsoleCounter(prev => prev + 1); // Increment consoleCounter
    setCounter(prev => prev + 1); // Increment counter
  }

  const removeValue = () => {
    setConsoleCounter(prev => prev - 1); // Decrement consoleCounter
    setCounter(prev => prev - 1); // Decrement counter
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>This is Counter {counter}</h1>
      {/* We didn't use addValue() directly to avoid immediate execution */}
      <button onClick={addValue}>Counter Up</button>
        
      <div><br /></div>
      
      <button onClick={removeValue}>Counter Down</button>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
